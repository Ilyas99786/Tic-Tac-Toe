# ❌⭕ Tic Tac Toe – Human vs Computer (Java)

### A Classic Game Built with Core Java 🎮

> *“Sometimes the simplest games teach the strongest logic.”*

---

## 📖 Introduction

**Tic Tac Toe** is a classic **console-based game** developed using **pure Java**, where a **human player competes against the computer**.  
This project focuses on implementing game logic, decision-making, and clean coding practices while keeping the user experience simple and engaging.

It is a beginner-friendly yet logical project that demonstrates strong fundamentals of Java programming.
